# RedWarn Link

RedWarn Link is a VS Code helper extension for RedWarn development. It has a feature which allows users to copy the link to the selected line(s) of the current file. The link is compatible with the RedWarn Helper Bot (@RedWarn Helper#7325), meaning you can paste the link directly into the RedWarn discord to generate a GitLab link.

## How to use

Open the command pallette (Windows/Linux: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>, Mac: <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd>), and select `RWLink: Copy Link`. The link will then be copied to your system keyboard, which you can then paste into the RedWarn discord.
